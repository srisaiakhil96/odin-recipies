    <img src="/odin-links-and-images/recipes/dosa.jpeg" alt="Finished Dosa">
    <p>A dosa, also called dosai, is a thin pancake in South Indian cuisine made from a fermented batter of ground black lentils and rice. Dosas are popular in South Asia as well as around the world. Dosas are served hot, often with chutney and sambar.</p>
    <p>The ingrediants required are as follows</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Urad dal (Split black lentils): 1 cup</li>
        <li>Parboiled rice or idli rice: 2 to 3 cups</li>
        <li>Fenugreek seeds: 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Salt: as per taste</li>
        <li>Water: for soaking and grinding</li>
        <li>Cooking oil: for making dosas</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can prepare a delicious dosa by following the below steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Soaking: The urad dal and rice are soaked separately for around 4-6 hours. Fenugreek seeds can be soaked along with urad dal.</li>

        <li>Grinding: After soaking, they are ground to a fine paste separately, then mixed together. The mixture should be of pouring consistency.</li>
            
        <li>Fermentation: Salt is added to the mixture, which is then left to ferment overnight (or for 8-10 hours). It will rise and double in volume.</li>
            
        <li>Making dosa: Heat a dosa pan or griddle, pour a ladle of batter in the center and spread it in a circular motion. Drizzle some oil around the edges and cook until the dosa is golden brown. Flip and cook the other side if desired.</li>
            
        <li>Serving: Dosa is usually served hot, often with sambar (a lentil-based vegetable stew) and coconut chutney.</li>
    </ol>
