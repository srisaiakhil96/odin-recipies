    <p>Idli is another popular South Indian dish. It's a type of steamed rice cake that's made from a fermented batter, similar to dosa.</p>
    <p>Here are the main ingredients typically required to make idli:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Urad dal (Split black lentils): 1 cup</li>
        <li>Idli rice or parboiled rice: 4 cups</li>
        <li>Fenugreek seeds: 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Salt: as per taste</li>
        <li>Water: for soaking and grinding</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here's a basic process of making idli:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Soaking: The urad dal and rice are soaked separately for around 4-6 hours. Fenugreek seeds can be soaked along with urad dal.</li>

        <li>Grinding: After soaking, they are ground to a fine paste separately, then mixed together. The mixture should be of a pouring consistency, but slightly thicker than dosa batter.</li>
            
        <li> Fermentation: Salt is added to the mixture, which is then left to ferment overnight (or for 8-10 hours). The batter will rise and double in volume.</li>
            
        <li> Making idli: After fermentation, the batter is poured into idli molds and steamed for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            
        <li>Serving: Idli is usually served hot with sambar (a lentil-based vegetable stew) and coconut chutney.</li>
    </ol>
